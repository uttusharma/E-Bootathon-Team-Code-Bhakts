### INTRODUCTION<br>
Stack is a linear data structure in which we restrict the operations over it in a particular order.

The order in which insertions and deletions are allowed is called LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out) i.e. the element that is inserted in the last is the first to come out or the element that is inserted first is the last to come out.

Both insertions and deletions to the stack are done only on one end called as top of the stack.

A Stack can be visualised as plates kept one over the other in a college canteen. Adding a plate or removing a plate happens only on the top. The plate on the top is the first to be be removed and the plate that is put first is the last to be removed.

The stack can be better understood using the following diagram.

### CONCEPT<br>
####The redistribution of energy by superposition of light waves is called as interference. When two or more waves superimpose over each other, resultant intensity is modified. The modification in the distribution of intensity in the region of superposition is called as interference. Interference fringes are alternately bright and dark patches of light obtained in the region of superposition.
####There is no loss of energy in interference phenomenon, only redistribution of energy takes place. The energy absent at dark places is actually present in bright regions.
####Alternate dark and bright rings formed due to presence of air film when plano-convex lens is placed on glass plate are called Newton’s rings.
####When a plano-convex surface is placed on a glass plate, an air film of gradually increasing thickness is formed. The thickness of the air film is symmetrical and increases outwards from the point of contact.
#### When monochromatic light is allowed to fall normally on this air film and viewed in reflected light, alternate dark and bright rings are observed. 
####The rings are formed as a result of interference between light waves reflected from the upper and lower surfaces of the air film developed between the convex surface of plano convex lens and plane glass plate.
####This is so because the air film formed is wedge shaped and loci of points of equal thickness of air film are circles concentric with point of contact.
####If 't' is the thickness of the air film at a point on the film, the refracted wavelet from the lens has to travel a distance 't' into the film, and after reflection from the top surface of the glass plate, it has to travel the same distance back to reach the point again. Thus, it travels a total path '2t'. One of the two reflections takes place at the surface of the denser medium and hence it introduces an additional phase change of π or an equivalent path difference λ/2 between two wavelets.<br>
####The centre of the ring pattern in Newton’s rings experiment with reflected light is dark because at the point of contact the path difference is zero but one of the interfering ray is reflected at the denser medium. This introduces effective path difference of λ/2. Thus the condition of minimum intensity is created hence centre of ring pattern is dark.<br>
####The corresponding ray diagram is as shown in Figure 1.
